# The Citizen Constitution Project

## Overview
The Citizen Constitution Project is a founder-led civic education initiative designed
to make constitutional knowledge more accessible, understandable, and engaging for
the general public.

The project emphasizes clarity, nonpartisan education, and real-world understanding
of constitutional processes, with content designed for adults, families, and students.

## Project Scope & Vision
This project was developed as a long-term educational platform rather than a static
marketing website. The scope includes public-facing educational content, structured
learning sections, and future interactive features intended to support civic literacy
across different age groups.

## Project Goals
- Make constitutional education more accessible to non-experts
- Present complex civic processes in clear, plain language
- Encourage informed, lawful, and peaceful civic participation
- Design content suitable for both adults and younger audiences
- Build a platform that can grow over time without redesigning core structure
